Description of functions defined in the py files in this folder. 

centerfinder.py file methods:

1. red_spores(image)
   finds the red spores, returns an image with red spores isolated from the raw image
   returns isolated red spores image

2. blue_spores(image)
   finds the blue spores, returns an image with blue spores isolated from the raw image
   returns isolated blue spores image

3. pink_spores(image)
   finds the pink spores, returns an image with pink spores isolated from the raw image
   returns pink spores image

4. find_centers(image, spores):
   finds the centres of the spore image passed to it
   uses watershed segmentation
   returns an array of coordinates (x, y) of the centres of the spore image passed

seq_finder.py file methods 

1. process_centers(centers, img_dims)
   uses the centre coordinates and image dimensions to assign position-wise scores to each centre
   returns scores

2. init_seq(image, red_centers, pink_centers, blue_centers)
   finds the unsorted sequence based on how many spores of each colour are present. 
   passes an array of alphabets based on which colour is present and a string of the colour-coded sequence

3. sort/_seq(seq_string, scores, sequence)
   finds the correct order of the spores in the cell using the scores assigned to each spore centre
   returns a sorted string sequence and the corresponding sorted string sequence

4. find_type(sequence, seq_string)
   finds the type of error based on a key (credits: MN Lab) for the error types and the sequences of the colours of the spores in each error type. 
   returns a string containing the type of error
